# PagSeguro Lib

A minimalist PagSeguro Client.

Any help is appreciated! Comment, suggestions, issues, PR's! Give us a star to help!

##Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a complete set of workflows to work with PagSeguro in a minimalist way avoiding the pitfalls that the original lib shared in their documentation have.

Currently it supports only the recurrent payment call in a simplistic way.
